# World Time to Live

A "simple" mod to automatically apply certain effects after a specified time period, or duration.

Hosting an timed event that's only available for 24 hours? Set the times and you're off!
Playing Build Battle with friends and want to set everyone to spectator after 10m? Easy!
Hosting a server and you wanna unlock it at exactly 7 PM? No worries!

See the (unfinished!) wiki for details.
